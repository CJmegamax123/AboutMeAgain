    <h1>About True Discord</h1>
    <p>Yo, My name is Carlos Jamerson Jr., or as anyone following my creative works or online presence would know me as, True Discord. I am a writer, artist, and musician who strives to make the world a better place through creative awareness. I have a passion for storytelling and advocating for various forms of social justice.</p>
    <p>True Discord has been a name I have used for many years, and it has gone through many changes. It started as a pen name for myself back in 2012, and now it is the name I use for my online presence. I have always been drawn to the idea of chaos and harmony coexisting and being able to fuel one-another, and the name Discord has always been a reflection of that.</p>
